# MNIST Digit Recognition with MLP

This project demonstrates a basic neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) model built with TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained, saved, and then used to predict both test samples and external image files.
